            <h1> About Me</h1>

            <p>
                Hello all! Thank you for visiting my Portfolio Website! My name is Collin Mathis and I have built this
                website
                and apps using self-taught methods. I understand this may not be the cleanest website, but I am eager
                and
                willing to learn new skills, techniques, and languages.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was born in Mississippi on the Gulf Coast in February of 1994. I attended the Poplarville School
                district
                for
                all my early life where I focused most of my time on computers and media. I then went on to two
                different
                Junior
                Colleges: Pearl River County Community College (2012-2014) and Jones County Junior College (2015-2016).
                There, I
                went to finish getting my Associates Degree in Computer Networking. I was in the Army National Guard for
                six
                years (2012-2018) serving as an Infantryman. I developed a lot of skill in Information Technology where
                I
                applied to create IT solutions for clients and put out “fires” where needed. I had discovered I had a
                natural
                ability and curiosity to discover and fix end users problems. Now am looking to pursue my actual dream
                of
                becoming a Software Developer and hopefully inspire kids like myself to embrace their passion and chase
                their
                dream no matter how difficult it may appear.
            </p>

                My path to becoming an aspiring developer started around 2012. I was in high school and just started
                thinking
                about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life (just like any eighteen-year-old would). I longed to
                work
                for
                the company that created my favorite video game, Bungie. So, I started researching what I needed to do
                to
                become
                a developer for Bungie. I thought to myself, “The best course to become a Bungie dev is to become a
                Computer
                Engineer.” I then built a project from a LED Cube Kit I found off the internet. I provided me with
                resistors,
                transistors, and LEDs along with a programable microchip and a PCB. I then put together the LED Cube and
                programmed different patterns and shapes using Java. I then turned this project into my high school as
                my
                Senior
                Project. As far as I know, my STEM teacher has it displayed in her office. Being able to create
                something
                with
                my hands using hardware and software bridge the gap from physical to virtual in my minds eye. I was
                hooked
                to
                technology.
            </p>

                I then enrolled at Pearl River Community College to start my basics to then transfer my credits to
                Mississippi
                State to further pursue my development as a Computer Engineer. After one year into my basics, I changed
                my
                major
                to Computer Science and then one more time to Computer Networking. I later joined the military in the
                middle
                of
                going to college, went to basic training, then back to college. I eventually finished my Computer
                Networking
                degree at Jones Country Junior College in 2016 and started working in the field of Information
                Technology
                that
                same year.
